Contribution Prerequisites
==========================

Contribution of data to the ACSC requires an account with valid organization membership on the `ACSC website <https://molecular-dynamics.atb.uq.edu.au/>`_ and access to a shared folder for the relevant organization (research group) on the `UQ RDM Cloud interface <https://cloud.rdm.uq.edu.au/>`_.

.. _Creating an ACSC Account:

Creating an ACSC Account
------------------------

Accounts on the `ACSC website <https://molecular-dynamics.atb.uq.edu.au/>`_ can be requested by contacting the ACSC.  Once an account has been provisioned, the account will need to be linked to an appropriate organization.  The list of organizations associated with the ACSC is available `here <https://molecular-dynamics.atb.uq.edu.au/organization/>`_.  The creation of additional organizations can be requested by contacting the ACSC.

.. _Creating an ACSC API Token:

Creating an ACSC API Token
--------------------------

Contribution of data to the ACSC also requires an API token.  These API tokens can be generated by users on the `ACSC website <https://molecular-dynamics.atb.uq.edu.au/>`_.  To generate a token, log in to the ACSC website by clicking "Log in" on the top navigation bar and entering your username and password.  

Once you are logged in, click on your user name on the top navigation bar to access your user profile.  Then, click on the "API Tokens" tab.  On this tab, create an API token by providing a name for the token (any name can be used) and clicking "Create API Token".  

After doing this, a green box will be displayed indicating that the API token has been successfully created.  Copy the API token by clicking on the copy button in the green box then paste this token into a file saved in a secure location.

.. warning::
    API tokens cannot be viewed again after navigating away from this page.  If you forget to save or lose your API token, the old token should be deleted from the "API Tokens" tab and a new token should be generated using the same procedure outlined in these instructions.

.. _Accessing UQ RDM Shared Folders:

Accessing UQ RDM Shared Folders
-------------------------------

Uploading of data to the ACSC is handled through the use of shared folders on the `UQ RDM Cloud interface <https://cloud.rdm.uq.edu.au/>`_.  To request access to the shared folder for your organization (research group), contact the ACSC with your `Australian Access Federation (AAF) <https://aaf.edu.au/>`_-affiliated e-mail address and the name of your organization.  A link will then be e-mailed to you containing instructions on how to access the shared folder for your organization.
