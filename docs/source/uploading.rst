Uploading Datasets
==================

After datasets have been successfully exported, the archives in :code:`export_path` can be uploaded to the ACSC server using the `UQ RDM Cloud interface <https://cloud.rdm.uq.edu.au/>`_.

To upload a dataset, click on the link to your UQ RDM shared folder as described in :ref:`Accessing UQ RDM Shared Folders` and upload the archives created in :ref:`Exporting Datasets` via the UQ RDM Cloud interface.
