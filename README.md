PyThinFilm is a Python package for fully automated Molecular Dynamics simulations
of thin film growth utilizing the GROMACS simulation package: www.gromacs.org.  PyThinFilm is capable of setting up and performing vacuum deposition, solution evaporation, as well as thermal annealing simulations.

## Prerequisites

Users are expected to have a familiarity with GROMACS and access to a GROMACS installation in path, along with an MPI implementation if parallel runs are to be performed.  


## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available at: https://atb-uq.github.io/PyThinFilm  All users are strongly encouraged to read this documentation which includes examples of performing different simulation types using PyThinFilm along with details of the meaning of the various configuration options available in the program.
